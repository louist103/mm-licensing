# mm-licensing

https://github.com/louist103/mm-licensing

This repository aims to track the (re)licensing of the contributions to the mm decomp hosted at https://github.com/zeldaret/mm

## TLDR

Goal: relicense [zeldaret/mm](https://github.com/zeldaret/mm) to CC0, need the contributors to agree.

## Get in touch

- GitHub: feel free to open an issue https://github.com/louist103/mm-licensing/issues
- Discord: join the dummy z64-licensing server https://discord.gg/rDvMsgnU2m

## Why?

The mm decomp source code is currently under no explicit license.

This means **authors reserve all rights** about the source being shared, modified, ... (see for example https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/)
besides the basic rights granted by the GitHub TOS, mainly forking.

This makes many people feel uneasy about using the source, since it's not explicitly allowed to be used.

Note the unofficial stance though, is that people can do whatever they want with the code without having to ask or credit.

The goal is to make that stance official. However to do it properly we need to ask the authors if they are okay with it.

## Which license?

CC0 is a license that seems to fit the unofficial stance.

It can be thought of as "public domain", or a more robust version of the Unlicense.

It also has the added benefit that it does not consist of a copyright affirmation, which is good given the murky waters decompilation is in.
